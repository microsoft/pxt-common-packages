# Uploading programs on your @boardname@

While you're writing and testing your programs, you'll mostly be [running them
in the simulator](/device/simulator), but once you've finished your program you
can **compile** it and run it on your @boardname@.

The basic steps are:

1. Connect your @boardname@ to your computer via USB
2. Press the reset button **once** and see that the **@drivename@** drive appears
2. Click **Download** and download the `.uf2` file
3. Copy the `.uf2` file from your computer onto the @drivename@ drive

### ~ hint

In Edge, Firefox and Internet Explorer, you can save the ``.uf2`` file directly into the @drivename@ drive!

## No @drivename@ drive

Make sure to press the reset button once when connected to turn on the @drivename@ drive.

## Multiple downloads

You can’t drag and drop more than one ``.uf2`` file at once onto your @boardname@. If
you try to drag and drop a second ``.uf2`` file onto your @boardname@  before the first
file has finished downloading, then the second file may fail in different ways.

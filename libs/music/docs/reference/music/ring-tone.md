# Ring Tone

Play a musical tone through a pin of your choice with the pitch as high or low as you say.
The tone will keep playing until you tell it not to.

## Simulator #sim

This function only works on the @boardname@ and in some browsers.

```sig
pins.A8.ringTone(0);
```

### Parameters

* ``pin`` is the pin to play the tone from.
* ``frequency`` is a [number](/types/number) that says
how high-pitched or low-pitched the tone is.  This
number is in **Hz** (**Hertz**), which is a measurement of frequency
or pitch.

### Example #example

This program checks the **accelerometer** for the @boardname@'s
**acceleration** (how much the @boardname@ is speeding up or slowing
down). Then it uses that acceleration to make a tone.  If the @boardname@
speeds up, the tone's pitch gets higher, and if it slows down, the
tone's pitch gets lower.  It's fun -- try it!

```blocks
loops.forever(() => {
    pins.A8.ringTone(input.acceleration(Dimension.X));
})
```
